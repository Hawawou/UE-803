Grimanesa Amorós (born 1962 in Lima, Peru) is a Peruvian-American artist known for large-scale light sculpture installations, where she draws inspiration from Peruvian cultural legacies and the communities surrounding her sculptures.
She has exhibited in Mexico, Tel Aviv, Beijing, and New York's Times Square.


== Early life and career ==
Grimanesa Amorós was born in Lima, Peru, and she became fascinated with drawing maps at a young age. 
 In her teens, she studied psychology and art. She attended the Miguel Gayo Art Atelier in Lima, Peru. When Amorós was eighteen, she exhibited a sold-out show featuring her paintings.
Amorós moved to New York City to work as an artist in the 1980s. Once there, she was awarded a scholarship to study painting and printmaking at the Art Students League of New York.
She started as a painter but later began to create three-dimensional artworks.

Grimanesa Amoro's art plays deftly with the notion that painting and sculpture might come into being through the process of shedding, as opposed to accumulation, the more physical aspects of form, so that the condition in which her subjects are presented does not function as a 'final' state at all, but more like one of several possible chosen moments within which the process of coming-into-being has been captured.

=== Uros Series ===

In her lighting sculptures, Amorós returns to the theme of the "Uros Islands", which are a series of floating islands in Lake Titicaca bordering Peru and Bolivia. The islands are made from dried totora reeds by the pre-Incan Uros people. When Amorós first visited the islands, she was struck by "the sense of weightlessness and spiritual connectivity" she experienced by walking on them.
The reeds are also used as a structural material to build everything from houses to boats in the Uros culture. Amorós has incorporated the shapes and patterns of these reeds into her lighting sculptures.
Works in the series include:


==== Uros House in Times Square ====
Part of the Times Square Alliance Public Arts Program in collaboration with The Armory Show (art fair) This piece was later on being exhibited at the Paul and Lulu Hilliard University Art Museum at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in Lafayette, Louisiana Uros House uses the traditional shape and design of the Uros islands houses to mirror the beauty of sea foam.
