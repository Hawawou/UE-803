second (late 1832) did, three chapters including one piece rate. book also contained ideas rational design factories, profit sharing. ==== ""babbage principle"" ==== economy machinery described called ""babbage principle"". pointed commercial advantages available careful division labour. babbage noted, already appeared work melchiorre gioia 1815. term introduced 1974 harry braverman. related formulations ""principle multiples"" philip sargant florence, ""balance processes"". babbage remarked skilled workers typically spend parts time performing tasks skill level. labour process divided among several workers, labour costs may cut assigning high-skill tasks high-cost workers, restricting tasks lower-paid workers. also pointed training apprenticeship taken fixed costs; returns scale available approach standardisation tasks, therefore favouring factory system. view human capital restricted minimising time period recovery training costs. ==== publishing ==== another aspect work detailed breakdown cost structure book publishing. babbage took unpopular line, publishers' perspective, exposing trade's profitability. went far name organisers trade's restrictive practices. twenty years later attended meeting hosted john chapman campaign booksellers association, still cartel. ==== influence ==== written ""what arthur young agriculture, charles babbage factory visit machinery"". babbage's theories said influenced layout 1851 great exhibition, views strong effect contemporary george julius poulett scrope. karl marx argued source productivity factory system exactly combination division labour machinery, building adam smith, babbage ure. marx picked babbage disagreed smith motivation division labour manufacturer: babbage did, wrote sake profitability, rather productivity, identified impact concept trade. john ruskin went further, oppose completely manufacturing babbage's sense stood for. babbage also affected economic thinking john stuart mill. george holyoake saw babbage's detailed discussion profit sharing substantive, tradition robert owen charles fourier, requiring attentions benevolent captain industry, ignored time. charles babbage's saturday night soirées, held 1828 1840s, important gathering places prominent scientists, authors aristocracy. babbage credited importing ""scientific soirée"" france well-attended saturday evening soirées. works babbage ure published french translation 1830; economy machinery translated 1833 french édouard biot, german year gottfried friedenberg. french engineer writer industrial organisation léon lalanne influenced babbage, also economist claude lucien bergery, reducing issues ""technology"". william jevons connected babbage's ""economy labour"" labour experiments 1870. babbage principle inherent assumption frederick winslow taylor's scientific management. mary everest boole claimed profound influence – via uncle george everest – indian thought general indian logic, particular, babbage husband george boole, well augustus de morgan: think must effect intense hinduizing three men babbage, de morgan, george boole mathematical atmosphere 1830–65. share generating vector analysis mathematics investigations physical science conducted? === natural theology === 1837, responding series eight bridgewater treatises, babbage published ninth bridgewater treatise, title power, wisdom goodness god, manifested creation. work babbage weighed side uniformitarianism current debate. preferred conception creation god-given natural law dominated, removing need continuous ""contrivance"". book work natural theology, incorporates extracts related correspondence herschel charles lyell. babbage put forward thesis god omnipotence foresight create divine legislator. book, babbage dealt relating interpretations science religion; one hand, insisted ""there exists fatal collision words scripture facts nature;"" hand, wrote book genesis meant read literally relation scientific terms. said conflict, wrote ""that contradiction imagined real existence, whilst testimony moses remains unimpeached, may also permitted confide testimony senses."" ninth bridgewater treatise quoted extensively vestiges natural history creation. parallel babbage's computing machines made explicit, allowing plausibility theory transmutation species could pre-programmed. jonar ganeri, author indian logic, believes babbage may influenced indian thought; one possible route would henry thomas colebrooke. mary everest boole argues babbage introduced indian thought 1820s uncle george everest: time 1825, [everest] came england two three years, made fast lifelong friendship herschel babbage, quite young. would ask fair-minded mathematician read babbage's ninth bridgewater treatise compare works contemporaries england; ask whence came peculiar conception nature miracle underlies babbage's ideas singular points curves (chap, viii) – european theology hindu metaphysic? oh! english clergy day hated babbage's book! === religious views === babbage raised protestant form christian faith, family inculcated orthodox form worship. explained: excellent mother taught usual forms daily nightly prayer; neither father mother mixture bigotry intolerance one hand, unbecoming familiar mode addressing almighty afterwards much disgusted youthful years. rejecting athanasian creed ""direct contradiction terms"", youth looked samuel clarke's works religion, attributes god (1704) exerted particularly strong influence him. later life, babbage concluded ""the true value christian religion rested, speculative [theology] ... ... upon doctrines kindness benevolence religion claims enforces, merely favour man every creature susceptible pain happiness."" autobiography passages life philosopher (1864), babbage wrote whole chapter topic religion, identified three sources divine knowledge: priori mystical experience revelation examination works creator stated, basis design argument, studying works nature appealing evidence, one led actively profess existence god. advocating natural theology, wrote: works creator ever open examination, possess firm basis raise superstructure enlightened creed. man inquires laws regulate material universe, convinced varied forms arise action simple principles ... works creator, ever present senses, give living perpetual testimony power goodness far surpassing evidence transmitted human testimony. testimony man becomes fainter every stage transmission, whilst new inquiry works almighty gives us exalted views wisdom, goodness, power. like samuel vince, babbage also wrote defence belief divine miracles. objections previously posed david hume, babbage advocated belief divine agency, stating ""we must measure credibility incredibility event narrow sphere experience, forget divine energy overrides familiarly call laws nature."" alluded limits human experience, expressing: ""all see miracle effect new observation, whose cause concealed. cause may beyond sphere observation, would thus beyond familiar sphere nature; make event violation law nature. limits man's observation lie within narrow boundaries, would arrogance suppose reach man's power form limits natural world."" == later life == british association consciously modelled deutsche naturforscher-versammlung, founded 1822. rejected romantic science well metaphysics, started entrench divisions science literature, professionals amateurs. belonging ""wattite"" faction baas, represented particular james watt younger, babbage identified closely industrialists. wanted go faster directions, little time gentlemanly component membership. indeed, subscribed version conjectural history placed industrial society culmination human development (and shared view herschel). clash roderick murchison led 1838 withdrawal involvement. end year sent resignation lucasian professor, walking away also cambridge struggle whewell. interests became focussed, computation metrology, international contacts. === metrology programme === project announced babbage tabulate physical constants (referred ""constants nature"", phrase neologism), compile encyclopaedic work numerical information. pioneer field ""absolute measurement"". ideas followed johann christian poggendorff, mentioned brewster 1832. 19 categories constants, ian hacking sees reflecting part babbage's ""eccentric enthusiasms"". babbage's paper tables constants nature art reprinted smithsonian institution 1856, added note physical tables arnold henry guyot ""will form part important work proposed article"". exact measurement also key development machine tools. babbage considered pioneer, henry maudslay, william sellers, joseph whitworth. === engineer inventor === royal society babbage acquired friendship engineer marc brunel. brunel babbage knew joseph clement, came encounter artisans observed work manufactures. babbage provided introduction isambard kingdom brunel 1830, contact proposed bristol & birmingham railway. carried studies, around 1838, show superiority broad gauge railways, used brunel's great western railway. 1838, babbage invented pilot (also called cow-catcher), metal frame attached front locomotives clears tracks obstacles; also constructed dynamometer car. eldest son, benjamin herschel babbage, worked engineer brunel railways emigrating australia 1850s. babbage also invented ophthalmoscope, gave thomas wharton jones testing. jones, however, ignored it. device came use independently invented hermann von helmholtz. === cryptography === babbage achieved notable results cryptography, though still known century death. letter frequency category 18 babbage's tabulation project. joseph henry later defended interest it, absence facts, relevant management movable type. early 1845, babbage solved cipher posed challenge nephew henry hollier, process, made discovery ciphers based vigenère tables. specifically, realised enciphering plain text keyword rendered cipher text subject modular arithmetic. crimean war 1850s, babbage broke vigenère's autokey cipher well much weaker cipher called vigenère cipher today. discovery kept military secret, published. credit result instead given friedrich kasiski, prussian infantry officer, made discovery years later. however, 1854, babbage published solution vigenère cipher, published previously journal society arts. 1855, babbage also published short letter, ""cypher writing"", journal. nevertheless, priority established 1985. === public nuisances === babbage involved well-publicised unpopular campaigns public nuisances. counted broken panes glass factory, publishing 1857 ""table relative frequency causes breakage plate glass windows"": 464 broken panes, 14 caused ""drunken men, women boys"". babbage's distaste commoners (the mob) included writing ""observations street nuisances"" 1864, well tallying 165 ""nuisances"" period 80 days. especially hated street music, particular music organ grinders, railed various venues. following quotation typical: difficult estimate misery inflicted upon thousands persons, absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes intellectual workers loss time, destroyed organ-grinders similar nuisances. babbage alone campaign. convert cause mp michael thomas bass. 1860s, babbage also took anti-hoop-rolling campaign. blamed hoop-rolling boys driving iron hoops horses' legs, result rider thrown often horse breaks leg. babbage achieved certain notoriety matter, denounced debate commons 1864 ""commencing crusade popular game tip-cat trundling hoops."" == computing pioneer == babbage's machines among first mechanical computers. actually completed largely funding problems clashes personality, notably george biddell airy, astronomer royal. babbage directed building steam-powered machines achieved modest success, suggesting calculations could mechanised. ten years received government funding project, amounted £17,000, eventually treasury lost confidence him. babbage's machines mechanical unwieldy, basic architecture similar modern computer. data program memory separated, operation instruction-based, control unit could make conditional jumps, machine separate i/o unit. === background mathematical tables === babbage's time, printed mathematical tables calculated human computers; words, hand. central navigation, science engineering, well mathematics. mistakes known occur transcription well calculation. cambridge, babbage saw fallibility process, opportunity adding mechanisation management. account path towards mechanical computation references particular occasion: 1812 sitting rooms analytical society looking table logarithms, knew full mistakes, idea occurred computing tabular functions machinery. french government produced several tables new method. three four mathematicians decided compute tables, half dozen broke operations simple stages, work itself, restricted addition subtraction, done eighty computers knew two arithmetical processes. here, first time, mass production applied arithmetic, babbage seized idea labours unskilled computers [people] could taken completely machinery would quicker reliable. another period, seven years later, interest aroused issues around computation mathematical tables. french official initiative gaspard de prony, problems implementation, familiar him. napoleonic wars came close, scientific contacts renewed level personal contact: 1819 charles blagden paris looking printing stalled de prony project, lobbying support royal society. works 1820s 1830s, babbage referred detail de prony's project. === difference engine === babbage began 1822 called difference engine, made compute values polynomial functions. created calculate series values automatically. using method finite differences, possible avoid need multiplication division. prototype difference engine, babbage brought joseph clement implement design, 1823. clement worked high standards, machine tools particularly elaborate. standard terms business time, could charge construction, would also them. babbage fell costs around 1831. parts prototype survive museum history science, oxford. prototype evolved ""first difference engine"". remained unfinished finished portion located science museum london. first difference engine would composed around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen short tons (13,600 kg), would 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. although babbage received ample funding project, never completed. later (1847–1849) produced detailed drawings improved version,""difference engine no. 2"", receive funding british government. design finally constructed 1989–1991, using plans 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. performed first calculation science museum, london, returning results 31 digits. nine years later, 2000, science museum completed printer babbage designed difference engine. ==== completed models ==== science museum constructed two difference engines according babbage's plans difference engine 2. one owned museum. other, owned technology multimillionaire nathan myhrvold, went exhibition computer history museum mountain view, california 10 may 2008. two models constructed replicas. === analytical engine === attempt making first difference engine fell through, babbage worked design complex machine called analytical engine. hired c. g. jarvis, previously worked clement draughtsman. analytical engine marks transition mechanised arithmetic fully-fledged general purpose computation. largely babbage's standing computer pioneer rests. major innovation analytical engine programmed using punched cards: engine intended use loops jacquard's punched cards control mechanical calculator, could use input results preceding computations. machine also intended employ several features subsequently used modern computers, including sequential control, branching looping. would first mechanical device be, principle, turing-complete. engine single physical machine, rather succession designs babbage tinkered death 1871. === ada lovelace italian followers === ada lovelace, corresponded babbage development analytical engine, credited developing algorithm would enable engine calculate sequence bernoulli numbers. despite documentary evidence lovelace's handwriting, scholars dispute extent ideas lovelace's own. achievement, often described first computer programmer; though programming language yet invented. lovelace also translated wrote literature supporting project. describing engine's programming punch cards, wrote: ""we may say aptly analytical engine weaves algebraical patterns jacquard loom weaves flowers leaves."" babbage visited turin 1840 invitation giovanni plana, developed 1831 analog computing machine served perpetual calendar. 1840 turin, babbage gave public explanation lectures analytical engine. 1842 charles wheatstone approached lovelace translate paper luigi menabrea, taken notes babbage's turin talks; babbage asked add something own. fortunato prandi acted interpreter turin italian exile follower giuseppe mazzini. === swedish followers === per georg scheutz wrote difference engine 1830, experimented automated computation. 1834 lardner's edinburgh review article set project own, doubting whether babbage's initial plan could carried out. pushed son, edvard scheutz. another swedish engine martin wiberg (1860). === legacy === 2011, researchers britain proposed multimillion-pound project, ""plan 28"", construct babbage's analytical engine. since babbage's plans continually refined never completed, intended engage public project crowd-source analysis built. would equivalent 675 bytes memory, run clock speed 7 hz. hoped complete 150th anniversary babbage's death, 2021. advances mems nanotechnology led recent high-tech experiments mechanical computation. benefits suggested include operation high radiation high temperature environments. modern versions mechanical computation highlighted economist special ""end millennium"" black cover issue article entitled ""babbage's last laugh"". due association town babbage chosen 2007 appear 5 totnes pound note. image babbage features british cultural icons section newly designed british passport 2015. == family == 25 july 1814, babbage married georgiana whitmore, sister british parliamentarian william wolryche-whitmore, st. michael's church teignmouth, devon. couple lived dudmaston hall, shropshire (where babbage engineered central heating system), moving 5 devonshire street, london 1815. charles georgiana eight children, four – benjamin herschel, georgiana whitmore, dugald bromhead henry prevost – survived childhood. charles' wife georgiana died worcester 1 september 1827, year father, second son (also named charles) newborn son alexander. benjamin herschel babbage (1815–1878) charles whitmore babbage (1817–1827) georgiana whitmore babbage (1818 – 26 september 1834) edward stewart babbage (1819–1821) francis moore babbage (1821–????) dugald bromhead (bromheald?) babbage (1823–1901) (maj-gen) henry prevost babbage (1824–1918) alexander forbes babbage (1827–1827) youngest surviving son, henry prevost babbage (1824–1918), went create six small demonstration pieces difference engine no. 1 based father's designs, one sent harvard university later discovered howard h. aiken, pioneer harvard mark i. henry prevost's 1910 analytical engine mill, previously display dudmaston hall, display science museum. == death == babbage lived worked 40 years 1 dorset street, marylebone, died, age 79, 18 october 1871;

took part local campaign early closing. edmund larken others set building society 1847. associated also chartist thomas cooper, whose wife relation. 1838 onwards, boole making contacts sympathetic british academic mathematicians reading widely. studied algebra form symbolic methods, far understood time, began publish research papers. == professorship life cork == boole's status mathematician

society (frs) 1857. received honorary degrees ll.d. university dublin university oxford. == works == boole's first published paper ""researches theory analytical transformations, special application reduction general equation second order"", printed cambridge mathematical journal february 1840 (volume 2, no. 8, pp. 64–73), led friendship boole duncan farquharson gregory, editor journal. works 50 articles separate publications. 1841, boole published influential paper early invariant theory. received medal royal society memoir 1844, ""on general method analysis"". contribution theory linear differential equations, moving case constant coefficients already published, variable coefficients. innovation operational methods admit operations may commute. 1847, boole published mathematical analysis logic, first works symbolic logic. === differential equations === boole completed two systematic treatises mathematical subjects lifetime. treatise differential equations appeared 1859, followed, next year, treatise calculus finite differences, sequel former work. === analysis === 1857, boole published treatise ""on comparison transcendent, certain applications theory definite integrals"", studied sum residues rational function. among results, proved called boole's identity: e { x ∈ r ∣ ℜ 1 π ∑ k x − b k ≥ } = ∑ k π {\displaystyle \mathrm {mes} \left\{x\in \mathbb {r} \,\mid \,\re {\frac {1}{\pi }}\sum {\frac {a_{k}}{x-b_{k}}}\geq t\right\}={\frac {\sum a_{k}}{\pi t}}} real numbers ak > 0, bk, > 0. generalisations identity play important role theory hilbert transform. === binary logic === 1847, boole published pamphlet mathematical analysis logic. later regarded flawed exposition logical system wanted investigation laws thought founded mathematical theories logic probabilities seen mature statement views. contrary widespread belief, boole never intended criticise disagree main principles aristotle's logic. rather intended systematise it, provide foundation, extend range applicability. boole's initial involvement logic prompted current debate quantification, sir william hamilton supported theory ""quantification predicate"", boole's supporter augustus de morgan advanced version de morgan duality, called. boole's approach ultimately much reaching either sides' controversy. founded first known ""algebra logic"" tradition. among many innovations principle wholistic reference, later, probably independently, adopted gottlob frege logicians subscribe standard first-order logic. 2003 article provides systematic comparison critical evaluation aristotelian logic boolean logic; also reveals centrality holistic reference boole's philosophy logic. ==== 1854 definition universe discourse ==== every discourse, whether mind conversing thoughts, individual intercourse others, assumed expressed limit within subjects operation confined. unfettered discourse words use understood widest possible application, them, limits discourse co-extensive universe itself. usually confine less spacious field. sometimes, discoursing men imply (without expressing limitation) men certain circumstances conditions speak, civilised men, men vigour life, men condition relation. now, whatever may extent field within objects discourse found, field may properly termed universe discourse. furthermore, universe discourse strictest sense ultimate subject discourse. ==== treatment addition logic ==== boole conceived ""elective symbols"" kind algebraic structure. general concept available him: segregation standard abstract algebra postulated (axiomatic) properties operations, deduced properties. work beginning algebra sets, concept available boole familiar model. pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, treatment addition obvious difficulty early days. boole replaced operation multiplication word ""and"" addition word ""or"". boole's original system, + partial operation: language set theory would correspond disjoint union subsets. later authors changed interpretation, commonly reading exclusive or, set theory terms symmetric difference; step means addition always defined. fact, possibility, + read disjunction. possibility extends disjoint union case, exclusive non-exclusive give answer. handling ambiguity early problem theory, reflecting modern use boolean rings boolean algebras (which simply different aspects one type structure). boole jevons struggled issue 1863, form correct evaluation x + x. jevons argued result x, correct + disjunction. boole kept result something undefined. argued result 0, correct exclusive or, saw equation x + x = 0 implying x = 0, false analogy ordinary algebra. === probability theory === second part laws thought contained corresponding attempt discover general method probabilities. goal algorithmic: given probabilities system events, determine consequent probability event logically connected events. == death == late november 1864, boole walked, heavy rain, home lichfield cottage ballintemple university, distance three miles, lectured wearing wet clothes. soon became ill, developing pneumonia. wife believed remedies resemble cause, wrapped wet blankets – wet brought illness. boole's condition worsened 8 december 1864, died fever-induced pleural effusion. buried church ireland cemetery st michael's, church road, blackrock (a suburb cork). commemorative plaque inside adjoining church. == legacy == boole namesake branch algebra known boolean algebra, well namesake lunar crater boole. keyword bool represents boolean datatype many programming languages, though pascal java, among others, use full name boolean. library, underground lecture theatre complex boole centre research informatics university college cork named honour. road called boole heights bracknell, berkshire named him. === 19th-century development === boole's work extended refined number writers, beginning william stanley jevons, also authored article boole encyclopaedia britannica. augustus de morgan worked logic relations, charles sanders peirce integrated work boole's 1870s. significant figures platon sergeevich poretskii, william ernest johnson. conception boolean algebra structure equivalent statements propositional calculus credited hugh maccoll (1877), work surveyed 15 years later johnson. surveys developments published ernst schröder, louis couturat, clarence irving lewis. === 20th-century development === 1921, economist john maynard keynes published book probability theory, treatise probability. keynes believed boole made fundamental error definition independence vitiated much analysis. book last challenge problem, david miller provides general method accord boole's system attempts solve problems recognised earlier keynes others. theodore hailperin showed much earlier boole used correct mathematical definition independence worked problems. boole's work later logicians initially appeared engineering uses. claude shannon attended philosophy class university michigan introduced boole's studies. shannon recognised boole's work could form basis mechanisms processes real world therefore highly relevant. 1937 shannon went write master's thesis, massachusetts institute technology, showed boolean algebra could optimise design systems electromechanical relays used telephone routing switches. also proved circuits relays could solve boolean algebra problems. employing properties electrical switches process logic basic concept underlies modern electronic digital computers. victor shestakov moscow state university (1907–1987) proposed theory electric switches based boolean logic even earlier claude shannon 1935 testimony soviet logicians mathematicians sofya yanovskaya, gaaze-rapoport, roland dobrushin, lupanov, medvedev uspensky. first publication shestakov's result took place 1941 (in russian). hence, boolean algebra became foundation practical digital circuit design; boole, via shannon shestakov, provided theoretical grounding information age. === 21st-century celebration === year 2015 saw 200th anniversary boole's birth. mark bicentenary year, university college cork joined admirers boole around world celebrate life legacy. ucc's george boole 200 project, featured events, student outreach activities academic conferences boole's legacy digital age, including new edition

leisure; claims science; social aspect intellectual culture. first 1835 charles anderson-pelham, 1st earl yarborough gave bust newton mechanics' institute lincoln. second justified celebrated 1847 outcome successful campaign early closing lincoln, headed alexander leslie-melville, branston hall. claims science given 1851 queen's college, cork. social aspect intellectual culture also given cork, 1855 cuvierian society. though biographer des machale describes boole ""agnostic deist"", boole read wide variety christian theology. combining interests mathematics theology, compared christian trinity father, son, holy ghost three dimensions space, attracted hebrew conception god absolute unity. boole considered converting judaism end said chosen unitarianism.[reference?] boole came speak saw ""prideful"" scepticism, instead favoured belief ""supreme intelligent cause"". also declared ""i firmly believe, accomplishment purpose divine mind."" addition, stated ""to infer existence

disconcerted book's reception mathematical toolset: george afterwards learned, great joy, conception basis logic held leibniz, contemporary newton. de morgan, course, understood formula true sense; boole's collaborator along. herbert spencer, jowett, robert leslie ellis understood, feel sure; others, nearly logicians mathematicians ignored [953] statement book meant throw light nature human mind; treated formula entirely wonderful new method reducing logical order masses evidence external fact. mary boole claimed profound influence – via uncle george everest – indian thought general indian logic, particular, george boole, well augustus de morgan charles babbage: think must effect intense hinduizing three men babbage, de morgan, george boole mathematical atmosphere 1830–65. share

also botvinnik's play better 1960 match, largely due thorough preparation. botvinnik changed style rematch, avoiding tactical complications tal excelled aiming closed positions endgames, tal's technique outstanding. finally, 1963, lost title tigran petrosian, 9½–12½ moscow. fide altered rules, allowed rematch. rematch rule nicknamed ""botvinnik rule"" twice benefited it. though ranking formal world champion, botvinnik relatively poor playing record early 1950s: played formal competitive games winning 1948 match tournament defended title, struggled draw 1951 championship match bronstein, placed fifth 1951 soviet championship, tied third 1952 géza maróczy memorial tournament budapest; also performed poorly soviet training contests. however, lost five thirty games two

moscow 1963, botvinnik withdrew following world championship cycle fide declined, annual congress 1965, grant losing champion automatic right rematch. remained involved competitive chess, appearing several highly rated tournaments continuing produce memorable games. botvinnik retired competitive play 1970, aged 59, preferring instead occupy development computer chess programs assist training younger soviet players, earning nickname ""patriarch soviet chess school"" (see below). botvinnik's autobiography, k dostizheniyu tseli, published russian 1978, english translation achieving aim (isbn 0-08-024120-4) 1981. staunch communist, noticeably shaken collapse soviet union lost standing russian chess boris yeltsin era. 1980s, botvinnik proposed computer program manage soviet economy. however, proposals receive significant attention soviet government. last years life, botvinnik personally financed economic computer project hoped would used manage russian economy. kept actively working program death financing work money made lectures seminars attended, despite prominent health problems. botvinnik died pancreatic cancer may 1995. according daughter, botvinnik remained active last months life, continued go work march 1995 despite blindness one eyes (and extremely poor vision other). == political controversies == soviet union regarded chess symbol communist superiority, hence soviet chess world extremely politicized. botvinnik first world-class player produced soviet union, everything said (or say do) political repercussions, rumors soviet opponents given hints beat him. david bronstein wrote boris verlinsky 1929 soviet championship granted first soviet grandmaster title achievement, yet later stripped it, thought politically correct make botvinnik first official soviet gm (as distinct then-nonexistent fide grandmaster title). botvinnik wrote last round 1935 moscow tournament, soviet commissar justice nikolai krylenko, also charge soviet chess, proposed ilya rabinovich deliberately lose botvinnik, ensure botvinnik took first place. botvinnik refused, saying ""... put piece en prise resign"". game drawn, botvinnik shared first place salo flohr. botvinnik sent effusive telegram thanks joseph stalin victory great tournament nottingham 1936. botvinnik played relatively poorly strong 1940 soviet championship, finishing tie fifth/sixth places, 11½/19, two full points behind igor bondarevsky andor lilienthal. world war ii way time, strong possibility little chess practice time future, botvinnik seems prevailed upon soviet chess leadership hold another tournament ""in order clarify situation"". wound 1941 absolute championship ussr, featured top six finishers 1940 event, playing four times. personal appeal defence minister, vyacheslav molotov, botvinnik exempted war work three days week order concentrate chess preparations. tournament convincingly, thus reclaimed position ussr's top player. bronstein claimed end 1946 groningen tournament, months death reigning world champion alexander alekhine, botvinnik personally invited samuel reshevsky, reuben fine, max euwe, vasily smyslov, paul keres join tournament decide new world champion, evidence suggests fide (the ""governing body"" chess), already proposed world championship tournament groningen tournament began, stage soviet union member therefore took part framing proposal. since keres lost first four games botvinnik 1948 world championship tournament, winning final cycle outcome tournament decided, suspicions sometimes raised keres forced ""throw"" games allow botvinnik win championship. chess historian taylor kingston investigated available evidence arguments, concluded that: soviet chess officials gave keres strong hints hinder botvinnik's attempt win world championship; botvinnik discovered half-way tournament protested strongly angered soviet officials; keres probably deliberately lose games botvinnik anyone else tournament. bronstein insinuated soviet officials pressured lose 1951 world championship match botvinnik would keep title, comments botvinnik's second, salo flohr, botvinnik's annotations critical 23rd game indicate botvinnik knew plot. 1956, fide changed world championship rules defeated champion would right return match. yuri averbakh alleged done urging two soviet representatives fide, personal friends botvinnik. averbakh also claims botvinnik's friends behind fide's decision 1956 limit number players country could compete candidates tournament, botvinnik's advantage reduced number soviet players might meet title match. botvinnik asked allowed play 1956 candidates tournament, wanted use event part warm-up next year's title match, request refused. mikhail tal's chronic kidney problems contributed defeat 1961 return match botvinnik, doctors riga advised postpone match health reasons. averbakh claimed botvinnik would agree postponement tal certified unfit moscow doctors, tal decided play. 1961 world championship lasted 21 games botvinnik ten them, total score +10−5=6, reclaiming title lost year earlier becoming oldest winner fide world championship match 50. 1963, botvinnik played last world championship match tigran petrosian, 22-game series. petrosian, almost 20 years younger, wore 52 year old botvinnik series protracted games, 40 moves, including six consecutive draws. defending champion played poorly games 18 19, match ended three short draws. petrosian thus claimed world championship score +5−2=15. 1954, wrote article inciting socialist revolution western countries, aiming spread communism without third world war. 1960 botvinnik wrote letter soviet government proposing economic reforms contrary party policy. 1976, soviet grandmasters asked sign letter condemning viktor korchnoi ""traitor"" korchnoi defected. botvinnik evaded ""request"" saying wanted write letter denouncing korchnoi. time, however, importance waned officials would give ""privilege"", botvinnik's name appear group letter – outcome botvinnik may foreseen. bronstein boris spassky openly refused sign letter. == assessment == === playing strength style === reuben fine, writing 1976, observed botvinnik near top chess world thirty years—from 1933, drew match flohr, 1963, lost world championship final time, petrosian—""a feat equaled historically emanuel lasker wilhelm steinitz"". statistical rating system used raymond keene nathan divinsky's book warriors mind concludes botvinnik fourth strongest player time: behind garry kasparov, anatoly karpov bobby fischer ahead josé raúl capablanca, lasker, viktor korchnoi, boris spassky, vasily smyslov tigran petrosian. chessmetrics system sensitive length periods compared places botvinnik third comparison players' best individual years (1946 botvinnik) sixth comparison fifteen-year periods (1935–1949 botvinnik's case). 2005, chessmetrics' creator jeff sonas wrote article examined various ways comparing strength ""world number one"" players, based chessmetrics; botvinnik generally emerged one top six (the greatest exceptions criteria related tournament results). fide adopt elo rating system 1970, time botvinnik's strength declining several years. according unofficial calculations arpad elo, botvinnik highest-rated player 1937 1954, peaking 2730 1946. may seem surprising light botvinnik's results 1950s early 1960s, failed win world championship match outright (as reigning champion) tournament results patchy. fide world championship cycle established 1948, reigning champions play strongest contender every three years, successful title defenses became less common pre-world war ii years, titleholder could select challenger. despite this, botvinnik held world title longer period successors except garry kasparov. botvinnik also became world champion relatively late age 37, world war ii brought international competition virtual halt six years; 52 years old finally lost title (only wilhelm steinitz emanuel lasker older defeated). botvinnik's best years 1935 1946; period dominated soviet chess; ussr's 15½–4½ win 1945 radio match us proved ussr's top players considerably better us (who dominated international team competitions 1930s). botvinnik generally sought tense positions chances sides; hence results often better black pieces could avoid lines likely produce draws. strong grasp long-term strategy, often willing accept weaknesses opponent could exploit exchange advantage could exploit. confessed relatively weak tactical calculation, yet many games feature sacrifices – often long-term positional sacrifices whose purpose force immediate win, improve position undermine opponent's. botvinnik also capable all-out sacrificial attacks thought position justified it. botvinnik saw ""universal player"" (all-rounder), contrast all-out attacker like mikhail tal defender like tigran petrosian. reuben fine considered botvinnik's collection best games one three beautiful mid-1950s (the two alexander alekhine's akiba rubinstein's). kasparov quotes tigran petrosian saying, ""there unpleasant feeling inevitability. conversation keres mentioned even compared botvinnik bulldozer, sweeps away everything path. keres smiled said: 'but imagine like play young?'"" === influence game === botvinnik's example teaching established modern approach preparing competitive chess: regular moderate physical exercise; analysing thoroughly relatively narrow repertoire openings; annotating one's games, past great players competitors; publishing one's annotations others point errors; studying strong opponents discover strengths weaknesses; ruthless objectivity one's strengths weaknesses. botvinnik also played many short training matches strong grandmasters including salo flohr, yuri averbakh, viacheslav ragozin, semion furman – noisy smoky rooms thought would face conditions actual competition. vladimir kramnik said, ""botvinnik's chess career way genius, although genius"", meaning botvinnik brilliant making best use talents. botvinnik used almost exclusively queenside pawn openings white pieces. eight world championship matches, never started game e4-opening, usual choices white english opening queen's gambit. playing black pieces, preferred french defense sicilian defense response 1.e4, slav defense nimzo-indian defence response 1.d4. botvinnik use wide range openings, made major contributions use, example: botvinnik variation semi-slav defense queen's gambit declined, kasparov/botvinnik system exchange variation queen's gambit declined, caro–kann defence (both panov–botvinnik attack white various approaches black), winawer variation french defense, botvinnik system english opening. openings research botvinnik aim produce tactical tricks would effective once, rather systems aimed understand typical positions possibilities better rivals. advice pupils included ""my theory openings fitted one notebook"" ""you know everyone knows, important know everyone knows."" fact used different notebooks different periods, copied analyses one notebook next. ""soviet school chess"" dominated competition 1945 2000 followed botvinnik's approach preparation openings research; and, although soviet players preferred styles play, adopted combative approach willingness ignore ""classical"" principles offered credible prospects lasting advantage. 1963, botvinnik founded school within soviet coaching system, graduates include world champions anatoly karpov, garry kasparov vladimir kramnik, top-class players alexei shirov, vladimir akopian jaan ehlvest. botvinnik infallible spotter chess talent: although said 11-year-old kasparov, ""the future chess lies hands young man"", said first seeing karpov, ""the boy clue chess, there's future profession."" karpov recounts fondly youthful memories botvinnik school credits botvinnik's training, especially homework assigned, marked improvement play. kasparov presents botvinnik almost kind father figure, going way towards balancing common public perception botvinnik dour aloof; kasparov inherited botvinnik's emphasis preparation, research innovation. botvinnik still playing major teaching role late 70s, kramnik entered school, made favorable impression pupil. == achievements == === electrical engineering === engineering much passion botvinnik chess – nottingham 1936, first major tournament win outside ussr, said ""i wish could he's done electrical engineering"" (referring milan vidmar, another grandmaster). awarded order badge honour work power stations urals world war ii (while also establishing world's strongest chess player). earned doctorate electrical engineering 1951. 1956, joined research institute electrical energy senior research scientist. 1960 published book asynchronized synchronous machines === computer chess === 1950s botvinnik became interested computers, first mainly playing computer chess later also co-authored reports possible use artificial intelligence managing soviet economy. botvinnik's research chess-playing programs concentrated ""selective searches"", used general chess principles decide moves worth considering. feasible approach primitive computers available soviet union early 1960s, capable searching three four half-moves deep (i.e. a's move, b's move, a's move, b's move) tried examine every variation. botvinnik eventually developed algorithm reasonably good finding right move difficult positions, often missed right move simple positions, e.g. possible checkmate two moves. ""selective"" approach turned dead end, computers powerful enough mid-1970s perform brute-force search (checking possible moves) several moves deep today's vastly powerful computers well enough beat human world champions. however, pioneer program contained generalized method decision-making that, adjustments, enabled plan maintenance power stations ussr. september 7, 1991 botvinnik awarded honorary degree mathematics university ferrara (italy) work computer chess. == writings == === chess === botvinnik, m.m.

late make fundamental contributions."" seven-week student internship ibm's hursley laboratory england, decided dedicate career computers. initially focused computer construction, reading book ibm 7030 stretch project described computer organization programmer's point view refocused interest toward becoming computer architect. === regnecentralen === completing master science degree electronic engineering 1963, brinch hansen landed job regnecentralen, research institution danish academy technical sciences (akademiet de tekniske videnskaber), working compiler group, led peter naur jørn jensen. there, first significant project writing parser cobol compiler siemens 3003 computer. subsequently, wrote file system used execution compiled cobol programs, later observing: understand really small operating system, programmed. however, mid 1960s, dividing line language implementation operating systems still clearly understood. 1966, brinch hansen moved henning isaksson's hardware group regnecentralen, company shareholders. together peter kraft, defined computer architecture instruction set regnecentralen's third computer, rc 4000, using algol 60 hardware description language produce formal specification. inexperienced multiprogramming, used copy cooperating sequential processes edsger dijkstra sent understand process synchronization using semaphores, implemented specialized rc 4000 real-time monitor use managing fertilizer plant. peter kraft charles simonyi, still teenager, wrote p-code interpreter data logging task programs compiled p-code. summer 1967, brinch hansen left regnecentralen's hardware group become head rc 4000 software development, led team including jørn jensen, peter kraft søren lauesen defining general-purpose rc 4000 multiprogramming system, goal avoid developing custom real-time control operating system every rc 4000 installation, support batch processing time-sharing well. resulting system complete operating system, small kernel providing mechanisms upon operating systems different purposes could built. spring 1969, well-documented, reliable version rc 4000 multiprogramming system running. === carnegie mellon university === late 1970, brinch hansen moved pittsburgh, accepting invitation alan perlis visit department computer science carnegie mellon university research associate, wrote first systematic textbook operating system principles. time, 1971 summer school marktoberdorf symposium belfast, brinch hansen, tony hoare dijkstra began discuss ideas evolved monitor concept. spring 1972, reading class concept invented ole-johan dahl kristen nygaard simula 67, brinch hansen completed text chapter resource protection proposed first monitor notation, using shared classes. 1973, operating system principles published, becoming first comprehensive textbook operating systems. === california institute technology === july 1972, brinch hansen joined faculty california institute technology (caltech) associate professor computer science, began work defining programming language concurrent processes monitors. april 1974, distributed technical report concurrent pascal. concurrent pascal compiler pdp 11/45, written brinch hansen's doctoral student, al hartmann, released january 1975. subsequently, brinch hansen began writing model operating systems concurrent pascal, evaluate language. may 1975, completed solo, single-user operating system development concurrent pascal programs. next, rewrote original rc 4000 real-time scheduler concurrent pascal, taking three days write it, three hours machine time systematically test it. caltech computer science department shifted focus toward computer engineering away programming brinch hansen decided leave, rather seek tenure there. === university southern california === 1976, brinch hansen chose university southern california (usc) next post, family could remain altadena home. joining faculty tenured full professor, first chair newly created computer science department, led efforts identify attract top-notch faculty build first rate department. 1980, usc's computer science department ranked national research council one top ten us. usc, brinch hansen wrote second book, architecture concurrent programs, based work developing operating systems concurrent pascal. published 1977, first book concurrent programming. 1978, brinch hansen became first computer scientist awarded doctor technices degree, highest academic distinction within engineering technological science denmark, work documented architecture concurrent programs. later 1978, brinch hansen published distributed processes language concept, proposing use remote procedure calls synchronize processes running across microcomputer network. also 1978, l. j. sevins steve goings mostek visited brinch hansen usc, outlined low-cost multiprocessor architecture. mostek began project implement multiprocessor, brinch hansen working consultant. brinch hansen developed new concurrent programming language, edison, project. rc 4000 project, edison also used formal specification language hardware. mostek got initial 4-node multiprocessor working brinch hansen wrote portable edison compiler pdp 11/55, shortly after, united technologies acquired mostek cancelled project. 1982, brinch hansen moved edison system ibm personal computer (pc), published third book, programming personal computer. 1982, brinch hansen named first henry salvatori professor computer science usc. === university copenhagen === 1984, feeling homesick denmark 14 years abroad, brinch hansen left usc joined faculty university copenhagen professor datalogy. 1985, elected fellow institute electrical electronics engineers (ieee). later 1985, fourth book brinch hansen pascal compilers, used compiler course, published. designing multicomputer operating system danish company gn elmi, brinch hansen concluded needed new language, time leveraging message passing paradigm hoare's csp. resulting language, joyce, removed major limitation csp introducing parallel recursion. brinch hansen developed portable implementation ibm pc. === syracuse university === finding neither family felt home denmark, brinch hansen decided return us, discovered immigration status required quickly. brinch hansen contacted john reynolds syracuse university 1987 joined faculty distinguished professor. working student rangachari anand, joyce moved encore multimax 320 multiprocessor su's northeast parallel architectures center. recognizing scaling limitations multiprocessors, however, brinch hansen sought suitable multicomputer work. acquiring meiko computing surface 1989, began experimenting scientific applications developing parallel programs householder's method (reduction) n-body simulation learning exercises, surprised find programs nearly identical control structures. concluding fit ""all-pairs paradigm,"" focused exploring reusable parallel algorithm structures termed ""programming paradigms"" ""generic programs"" (later, popularly known ""design patterns""). 1995, brinch hansen's fifth book, studies computational science: parallel programming paradigms published, programs rewritten superpascal, fully implemented publication language created parallel algorithms. === last years === later years, brinch hansen published retrospective important papers, search simplicity (1996), text course programming non-majors, programming everyone java (1999), retrospective evolution operating systems, classic operating systems: batch processing distributed systems (2001), retrospective evolution concurrent programming, origin concurrent programming: semaphores remote procedure calls (2002). self-published 2004 memoir, programmer's story: life computer pioneer, website. 2002, brinch hansen awarded ieee computer pioneer award ""for pioneering development operating systems concurrent programming exemplified work rc 4000 multiprogramming system, monitors, concurrent pascal."" july 31, 2007, brinch hansen died, shortly diagnosed terminal cancer. == personal life == brinch hansen met wife milena (née hrastar) class trip yugoslavia 1962. married 1965 two children, daughter mette son thomas. == scientific contributions influence == career spanning five decades, brinch hansen made seminal contributions areas operating systems, concurrent computing parallel distributed computing influential shaping development fields advancing ad hoc techniques systematic engineering disciplines. influence work amplified ""relentless search simplicity,"" insistence clarity, writing rewriting papers many times publishing them, becoming ""one best explainers business,"" commitment testing concepts working systems – brinch hansen implemented distributed working systems new concepts developed, noting: uncommon computer scientist make proposal without testing whether good practice. spending 3 days writing monitor proposal 3 years implementing it, well understand temptation. perhaps also sometimes human response tremendous pressure university professors get funding recognition fast. nevertheless, must remember one thing counts engineering: work (not ""might work"" ""wouldn't nice did"")? === operating systems === rc 4000 multiprogramming system introduced now-standard concept operating system kernel separation mechanism policy operating system design. modern microkernel architectures trace roots extensible nucleus architecture rc 4000. improving microkernel performance major theme operating system research three decades rc 4000. brinch hansen's text, operating system principles, first comprehensive textbook operating systems. eventually published six languages (english, japanese, german, czech, polish serbo-croatian), remained print decades, years rc 4000 system described become outdated. 1990, nearly two decades initial publication, p. j. plauger reviewed it, saying: book terribly dated. describes many rc4000's operating-system algorithms. rc4000 slow, small, starved peripherals today's standards. algorithms presented subset pascal. bother? answer brinch hansen one best explainers business. explains things clearly point. eye general principle behind example, manages avoid unnecessary abstraction. years, still pleasure read. 2005, association computing machinery (acm) members voted operating system principles top 25 classic book, survey choose out-of-print classic books add acm digital library. operating system principles ranked 15th survey, appearing 8.8% ballots. available acm digital library. using concurrent pascal, brinch hansen demonstrated feasible fully implement operating systems high level languages, reduced development effort one two orders magnitude. furthermore, entire operating systems could published, understood entirety. brinch hansen precisely architecture concurrent programs, leading roy maddux harlan mills declare: part two book indeed remarkable. here, entire operating system visible, every line program open scrutiny. hidden mystery, studying extensive examples, reader feels could tackle similar jobs could change system will. never seen operating system shown detail manner amenable modification. === concurrent programming === brinch hansen hoare developed monitor concept. brinch hansen published first monitor notation, adopting class concept simula 67, invented queueing mechanism. hoare refined rules process resumption. brinch hansen created first implementation monitors, concurrent pascal. dozen additional monitor-based languages created 1990: simone, modula, csp/k, ccnpascal, ply, pascal plus, mesa, sb-mod, concurrent euclid, pascalc, concurrent c, emerald, real-time euclid, pascal-fc, turing plus, predula. concurrent pascal first concurrent programming language: first language developed specifically concurrent programming, importantly, first language demonstrate possible incorporate secure, high-level facilities concurrency, system could guarantee processes access disjoint sets variables interfere time dependent ways. hoare described ""an outstanding example best academic research area."" source portable code concurrent pascal solo operating system distributed least 75 companies 100 universities 21 countries, resulting widespread adoption, porting adaptation industry academia. greg andrews observed concurrent pascal monitors ""greatly influenced subsequent concurrent language proposals."" brinch hansen's architecture concurrent programs first book concurrent programming, eventually published three languages (english, japanese, german). dozen years publication, p. j. plauger observed: sure, improvements made past dozen years. better synchronization algorithms fancier (if necessarily better) languages concurrency control. find better overview concurrent programming book. least found one. 2005, acm members voted architecture concurrent programs top 25 classic book, ranking 18th survey, appearing 8% ballots. available acm digital library. === distributed computing remote procedure call === remote procedure calls used modern operating systems trace roots back rc 4000 multiprogramming system, used request-response communication protocol process synchronization. 1978 paper distributed processes, brinch hansen proposed language distributed computing based external requests consisting procedure calls processes. later became known operating system context remote procedure call. later, brinch hansen developed two languages extending hoare's csp message-passing paradigm parallel recursion, showed efficiently implement such. == honors awards == doctor technices, technical university denmark, architecture concurrent programs, 1978 first henry salvatori professor computer science, university southern
