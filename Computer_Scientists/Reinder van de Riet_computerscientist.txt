Reinder Pieter (Reind) van de Riet (22 April 1939, Groningen â€“ 18 December 2008, Baarn) was a Dutch computer scientist and Emeritus Professor Information Systems at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, known for the development of COLOR-X, a linguistically-based event modeling language for object modeling.
Van de Riet received his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in computer science at the University of Amsterdam in 1968 under supervision of Adriaan van Wijngaarden for the thesis, entitled "ALGOL 60 as Formula Manipulation Language." In 1970, he was appointed Professor Information Systems at the VU University Amsterdam, where he retired August 2000. Among his Ph.D. students were Peter Apers (1982), Martin L. Kersten (1985), Frank Dignum (1989), Roel Wieringa (1990) and Frances Brazier (1991).
Van de Riet was editor of Europe of Data and Knowledge Engineering journal and member of the Editorial Board of the Information Systems Journal. His research interests were in the field of "database and Knowledge bases; the use of Linguistics; Security and Privacy problems; and computational auditing." He was knighted into the Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw. He died in Baarn, Netherlands, 18 December 2008, shortly after a lecture trip through the United States.
