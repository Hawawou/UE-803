James Ze Wang (Chinese: 王则; born 1972) is a Chinese-American computer scientist. He is a distinguished professor of the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Pennsylvania State University. He is also an affiliated professor of the Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences Program; the Computational Science Graduate Minor; and the Social Data Analytics Graduate Program. He is co-director of the Intelligent Information Systems Laboratory. He was a visiting professor of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University from 2007 to 2008. In 2011 and 2012, he served as a program manager in the Office of International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation.
He is the second son of Chinese mathematician Wang Yuan.


== Education ==

Wang received a summa cum laude bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Minnesota (advisor: Dennis Hejhal), an M.S. in mathematics and an M.S. in computer science, both from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. degree in medical information sciences from Stanford University's Biomedical Informatics and Database groups (advisor: Gio Wiederhold, committee members: Hector Garcia-Molina and Stephen T.C. Wong).


== Research ==

Wang is the author or coauthor of two monographs and over 100 journal articles, book chapters, and refereed conference papers, including one coauthored paper published in Science. His works have been widely cited. For example, SIMPLIcity: Semantics-Sensitive Integrated Matching for Picture Libraries (2001) has received more than 2000 citations. Image Retrieval: Ideas, Influences, and Trends of the New Age (2008) has received about 4000 citations.
He has carried out work with the Biomedical Informatics Group and the Computer Science Database Group at Stanford that makes possible the retrieval of specific images from databanks of images. He has co-developed the SIMPLIcity semantics-sensitive image retrieval system, the ALIPR automatic linguistic indexing of pictures system, and the ACQUINE visual aesthetics rating system.  These systems have been applied to several domains including biomedical image analysis, satellite imaging, Web image filtering, and art and cultural imaging. The SIMPLIcity system has been sought after and obtained by researchers from more than 100 institutions.
His studies have also involved retrieval from large-scale genome databases through pattern recognition. His research work has been reported widely by significant media including Discovery, Scientific American, MIT Tech Review, Public Radio, NPR, and CBS.
Wang has served as a General Chair for the 11th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval (Philadelphia, March 2010), a Program Committee Vice Chair for the 12th International World Wide Web Conference and as an ad hoc reviewer for 60+ scientific journals and many conferences. He has served on the EU/DELOS-US/NSF Working Group on Digital Imagery for Significant Cultural and Historical Materials and provided a written testimony at the National Academies Committee on Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content.
Wang was featured in a PBS series NOVA ScienceNow (Art Authentication, Season 3 and Season 4).  He contributed in developing new computerized methods to help detect fake Van Gogh paintings by analyzing the direction and amount of brushstrokes in the painting, as compared to original Van Gogh's.  He was successful in determining the fake version of the painting, produced by Charlotte Caspers, from the original.


== Awards ==
Wang has been a recipient of an NSF Career award and the endowed PNC Technologies Career Development Professorship (provided to Penn State by the PNC Foundation).
