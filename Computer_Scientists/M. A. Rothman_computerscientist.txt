His writing in Darwin's Cipher was called a "smart, engrossing tale that entertainingly uses science." The writing in Time Trials, co-authored with D. J. Butler, was described as "highly enjoyable" and "entertaining", having well-developed characters, and praised for "refreshingly [showing] respect for ancient civilizations and their accomplishments".
