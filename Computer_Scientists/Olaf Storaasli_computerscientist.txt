Olaf O. Storaasli is a scientist & engineer who worked at NASA[1]),  Oak Ridge National Laboratory[2]), Centrus Energy, & Synective Labs. At NASA, he led a hardware, software & applications teams to successfully develop one of NASA's first parallel computers, the finite element machine, & developed rapid matrix equation algorithms tailored for high-performance computers to harness FPGA & GPU accelerators to solve science & engineering applications. He was a graduate advisor & instructor at the University of Tennessee, George Washington University & Christopher Newport University. 


== Education ==
Storaasli received a B.A. in physics, mathematics, & French at Concordia College (1964). He went on to earn an M.A. in mathematics at University of South Dakota (1966) and a Ph.D in engineering mechanics at NCSU (1970). He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Norwegian University of Science & Technology ([3] (1984–85]) & the University of Edinburgh(2008).


== Research ==
He develops, tests and documents parallel analysis software to speed matrix equation solution to simulate physical & biological behavior on advanced-computer architectures (e.g. NASA's GPS solver based on prior Finite element machine and rapid parallel analysis of Space Shuttle SRB redesign earned Cray's 1st GigaFLOP Performance Award at Supercomputing '89).
