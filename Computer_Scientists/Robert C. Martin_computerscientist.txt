Robert Cecil Martin (born 5 December 1952), colloquially called "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer, instructor, and author. He is most recognized for promoting many software design principles and for being an author and signatory of the influential Agile Manifesto.
Martin has authored many books and magazine articles. He was the editor-in-chief of C++ Report magazine and served as the first chairman of the Agile Alliance.
Martin joined the software industry at age 17 and is self-taught.


== Companies ==
In 1991, Martin founded Object Mentor, now defunct, which provided instructor-led training on the extreme programming methodology. As of November 2023, he operated Uncle Bob Consulting, which provides consulting and training services. He is also a "Master Craftsman / Mentor" at Clean Coders, a company which is run by his son Micah Martin, and produces training videos.


== Software principles and advocacy ==
Martin is a proponent of software craftsmanship, agile software development, and test-driven development.
He is credited with coining the SOLID mnemonic, a collection of software principles. The principles are as follows: "Single Responsibility Principle", "Open-Closed Principle" (invented by Bertrand Meyer), "Liskov Substitution Principle" (invented by Barbara Liskov), "Interface Segregation Principle", and "Dependency Inversion Principle".
