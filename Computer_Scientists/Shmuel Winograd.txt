Shmuel Winograd (Hebrew: שמואל וינוגרד; January 4, 1936 – March 25, 2019) was an Israeli-American computer scientist, noted for his contributions to computational complexity. He has proved several major results regarding the computational aspects of arithmetic; his contributions include the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm and an algorithm for the fast Fourier transform which transforms it into a problem of computing convolutions which can be solved with another Winograd's algorithm.
Winograd studied Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1959. He received his Ph.D. from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University in 1968. He joined the research staff at IBM in 1961, eventually becoming director of the Mathematical Sciences Department there from 1970 to 1974 and 1980 to 1994.
