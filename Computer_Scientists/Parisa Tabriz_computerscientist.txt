Parisa Tabriz is an Iranian-American computer security expert who works for Google as a Vice President of engineering. She chose the title "Security Princess" on her business card.


== Early life ==
Parisa Tabriz was born to an Iranian father, a doctor, and an American mother, a nurse, of Polish-American descent. She grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and is the older sister of two brothers. Tabriz was not exposed to coding and computer science until her first year at university.


== Education ==
Tabriz initially enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign to study computer engineering, but soon became interested in computer science instead. She completed a bachelor of science and master of science degree at the university and did research in wireless security and attacks on privacy-enhancing technologies, co-authoring papers with her advisor Nikita Borisov. She was an active member of a student club interested in computer security, which she joined because her own website was hacked.


== Career ==
Tabriz was offered a summer internship with Google's security team while at college, and joined the company a few months after her graduation in 2007. While preparing to attend a conference in Tokyo with Google, she decided to use the job title "Security Princess" on her business card rather than the conventional "information security engineer" since it sounded less boring and considered it ironic. Tabriz trained Google staff interested in learning more about security and worked with youth at DEFCON and Girl Scouts of the USA to expose a more diverse set of people to the field of computer security.
