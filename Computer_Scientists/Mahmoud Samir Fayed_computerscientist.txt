Mahmoud Samir Fayed (born December 29, 1986) is a computer programmer, known as the creator of the PWCT programming language. PWCT is a free open source visual programming language for software development. He also created or designed Ring. He is a researcher at King Saud University. Prior to that, he worked at the Riyadh Techno Valley in the Information and Communication Technology Incubator.


== Background ==
Fayed started to learn computer programming at 10 years old under the supervision of his father who works as a computer programmer. He started using the Clipper programming language under MS-DOS. In 2006 he wrote free Arabic programming books. He studied computer science at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Menoufia University, Egypt, graduating in 2008.
Fayed received a Master's degree in 2017, from the College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.


== Career ==


=== PWCT language ===
In 2005 Fayed began work on a new visual programming language called PWCT and distributed it as a free-open source project in 2008.


=== Supernova language ===
In 2009 Fayed began work on a new programming language called Supernova and distributed it as a free-open source project in 2010. The language support writing the source code in Arabic/English keywords at the same time and it's a Domain-specific language for GUI development using natural code. Supernova is developed using PWCT.


=== JVLC Journal ===
In 2013 Fayed worked with other researchers as a reviewer for the Journal of Visual Languages and Computing. The journal is published by Elsevier.


=== LASCNN algorithm ===
In 2013â€“2014 Fayed worked with other researchers on designing the LASCNN algorithm. In graph theory, LASCNN is a Localized Algorithm for Segregation of Critical/Non-critical Nodes. The LASCNN algorithm establishes k-hop neighbor list and a duplicate free pair wise connection list based on k-hop information. If the neighbors are stay connected then the node is non critical.


=== Ring language ===
In 2013 Fayed began work on a new programming language called Ring and distributed it as a free-open source project in 2016. Ring aims to offer a language focused on helping the developer with building natural interfaces and declarative DSLs.


=== Machine Learning ===
In 2022-2023 Fayed worked with other researchers on developing different machine learning models and solutions. One of these models uses natural language processing to predict the citations count of research papers in Otology field using the paper title, abstract and authors. the results indicate that using neural networks provides the best results compared to other algorithms like linear regression and random forest. The paper abstract has more influence on the citations number compared to the paper title or authors names.  
Also, they developed a model to predict the post-operative electrode impedances after cochlear implantation surgery. These models are developed using Ring and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.
