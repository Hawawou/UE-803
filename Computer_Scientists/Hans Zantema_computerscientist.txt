Hans Zantema (1956) is a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist, and professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen, known for his work on termination analysis.


== Biography ==
Born in Goingarijp, The Netherlands, Zantema received his PhD in algebraic number theory in 1983 at the University of Amsterdam under supervision of Hendrik Lenstra Jr. for the thesis, entitled "Integer Valued Polynomials in Algebraic Number Theory."
After graduation Zantema spent a few years of employment in the industry before he switched to computer science: from 1987 to 2000 at Utrecht University and since 2000 at Eindhoven University of Technology.
Since 2007 he is a part-time full professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen. His main achievements are in term rewriting systems, in particular in automatically proving termination of term rewriting. His name is attached to 
Zantema's problem, namely does the string rewrite system 0011 -> 111000 terminate.
