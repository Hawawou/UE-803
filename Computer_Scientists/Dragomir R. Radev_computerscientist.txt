Dragomir R. Radev (August 7, 1968 â€“ March 29, 2023) was an American computer scientist who was a professor at Yale University, working on natural language processing and information retrieval. He also served as a University of Michigan computer science professor and Columbia University computer science adjunct professor, as well as a Member of the Advisory Board of Lawyaw.
Radev worked in the fields of open domain question answering,  multi-document summarization, and the application of NLP in Bioinformatics, Social Network Analysis and Political Science.
Radev received his PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University in 1999. He had served on the executive committee of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and as survey editor and associate editor of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.
Radev died on March 29, 2023, at the age of 54.
