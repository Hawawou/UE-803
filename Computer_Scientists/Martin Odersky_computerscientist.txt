He specializes in code analysis and programming languages. He spearheaded the design of Scala and Generic Java (and Pizza before).
In 1989, he received his Ph.D. from ETH Zurich under the supervision of Niklaus Wirth, who is best known as the designer of several programming languages, including Pascal. He did postdoctoral work at IBM and Yale University.
In 1997, he implemented the GJ compiler, and his implementation became the basis of javac, the Java compiler.

In 2007, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
On 12 May 2011, Odersky and collaborators launched Typesafe Inc. (renamed Lightbend Inc., February 2016 (2016-02)), a company to provide commercial support, training, and services for Scala.
He teaches three courses on the Coursera online learning platform: Functional Programming Principles in Scala, Functional Program Design in Scala and Programming Reactive Systems.
