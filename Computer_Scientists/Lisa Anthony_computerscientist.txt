Lisa Anthony is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) at the University of Florida. She is also the director of the Intelligent Natural Interaction Technology Laboratory (INIT Lab). Her research interests revolve around developing natural user interfaces to allow for greater human-computer interaction, specifically for children as they develop their cognitive and physical abilities.


== Education ==
Lisa Anthony earned her B.S. and M.S. in computer science with official concentrations in artificial intelligence, human-computer Interaction, and software engineering at Drexel University. Her M.S. thesis involved using genetic programming to evolve board evaluation functions for the strategy board game Acquire. As a summer graduate intern, she worked on the Collaborative Exploratory Search project at the Fuji-Xerox Palo Alto Laboratory (FXPAL).
In 2008, she earned her Ph.D. from the Human Computer Interaction Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008. Her Ph.D. thesis focused on developing handwriting-based systems for algebra equation-solving.


== Career ==
Anthony was also a Post-Doctoral Research Associate, then a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. She worked on advanced user interface technologies as a senior member of the engineering staff at the User-Centered Interfaces Group at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories. She is an currently an  Associate Professor in the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering at University of Florida.
