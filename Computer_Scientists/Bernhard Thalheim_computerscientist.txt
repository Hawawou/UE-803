Bernhard Karl Thalheim (born 10 March 1952 in Radebeul) is a German computer scientist and professor of information systems engineering at the University of Kiel in Kiel, Germany. He is known for his work on conceptual modeling and its theoretical foundational contributions.


== Biography ==

Born in Radebeul (near Dresden), Germany, Thalheim received his M.Sc. in mathematics and computer science in 1975 at the Dresden University of Technology, his PhD in discrete mathematics in 1979 at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, and his habilitation in theoretical computer science in 1985 at the Dresden University of Technology.
From 1986-89, he was an associate professor at the Dresden University of Technology. In 1989 he moved to the University of Rostock, where he was professor until 1993. From 1993 to 2003 he was dean and full professor at the Brandenburg Technical University, and since 2003 he is professor at the Christian-Albrechts-Universität of Kiel. Thalheim has been visiting professor at the Kuwait University; at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria; at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences; and at Massey University at Palmerston North, New Zealand.
Thalheim has received a number of awards for his achievements in information systems engineering. He was honored in 2005 as the Kolmogorov Professor h.c. at Lomonosov Moscow State University, on 22 October 2008, received the Peter P. Chen Award of Elsevier for Entity–relationship model research, is the founder of the German Chapter of DAMA, international Vice-Chair of the steering committee of the FoIKS conferences, Member of steering committees of conferences, e.g. ER, ADBIS, ASM, NLDB Editor of Data and Knowledge Engineering and other journals, and member of the advisory board of Dataport.


== Work ==


=== Conceptual modeling ===
The foundational contributions to conceptual modeling theory and Science of Conceptual Modeling of Thalheim can be found at multiple levels and abstractions, such as:

Higher Order Extended ER model,
Dependencies in relational databases and
Handbook of Conceptual Modeling, Chapter 4
With this work Thalheim contributed to the formalization and theoretical underpinning of conceptual modeling.
His ideas about conceptual modeling foundations and theory have been applied in field as:

Semantics in databases for generalized functional dependencies for user-friendly database designing,
Co-design as a holistic approach for collaboration and corporation in design of information systems applications,
Micro, meso and macro levels of users work leading to the development of collaboration frameworks for distributed Web information systems,
Conceptualization of theories in various application areas for the foundation of content management systems,
Model suites as the design theory and foundation of multi-model engineering for handling information system models and their evolution complexities,
Business process modeling and notations beyond business process modeling leading to database management foundations, and
The systematic development of internet sites leading to Web information systems.


=== Other developments ===
RADD : Rapid application and database development (toolbox for development of structures, constraints, functions, views and interfaces for database systems)
VisualSQL : Visual database querying
