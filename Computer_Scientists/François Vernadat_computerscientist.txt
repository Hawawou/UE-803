François B. Vernadat (born 1954) is a French and Canadian computer scientist, who has contributed to Enterprise Modelling, Enterprise Integration and Networking over the last 40 years specialising in Enterprise Architectures, business process modelling, information systems design and analysis, systems integration and interoperability and systems analysis using Petri nets.


== Biography ==
F. Vernadat studied from 1973 until 1981 at the University of Clermont, France, where he received a master's degree in Electronics and Automatic Control and a PhD in 1981. He has been a research officer first at the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC), Ottawa, from 1981 until 1988, and then at Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA), France, until Sept. 1995. From 1995 until 2001 he has been a professor at the University of Metz, France in automatic control and industrial engineering, the head of the Department on Automation and Industrial Engineering (AGIP), the head of the MACSI Project at INRIA, and the director of the Laboratory for Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Production (LGIPM). At the end of 2001, he joined the European Commission, DG Eurostat in Luxemburg, as an administrator in the IT Directorate and then moved to DG Informatics (DIGIT) until Jan 2008. Since then he has been head of the Information Systems unit of the European Court of Auditors, another European institution. He is currently an associate member of the LGIPM (Laboratory for Industrial Engineering, Production and Maintenance) of University of Lorraine, Metz, France.
He has served for many years as associate editor for several scientific journals including "Computers in Industry", "International Journal of Production Research", "Enterprise Information Systems", "International Journal of Industrial Information Integration", and "Computers & Industrial Engineering" as well as the advisory board of "International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing". He has been on the scientific committee of several other journals.
