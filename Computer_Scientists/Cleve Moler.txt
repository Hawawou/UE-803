Cleve Barry Moler (born August 17, 1939) is an American mathematician and computer programmer specializing in numerical analysis. In the mid to late 1970s, he was one of the authors of LINPACK and EISPACK, Fortran libraries for numerical computing.  He created MATLAB, a numerical computing package, to give his students at the University of New Mexico easy access to these libraries without writing Fortran.  In 1984, he co-founded MathWorks with Jack Little to commercialize this program.
